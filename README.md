# Monitor-The-Weather-With-Arduino-IoT-Cloud
In 2019, Arduino announced the addition of the IoT Cloud service as part of its Create Online environment. This end-to-end, low-code cloud solution makes it easy for IoT enthusiasts and professionals to register supported devices and enable interaction/data flow with minimum fuss, integrating seamlessly with MQTT, IFTTT, WebSockets, and more. Objects connected to the platform can easily be put into IoT workflows and scaled up for the management of fleets of devices from a single online dashboard.  In this session, we’ll show you how to set up for the IoT cloud with an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 connected to a DHT11 sensor that will procure and transmit ambient temperature and humidity readings for a location. We’ll create an online dashboard to monitor these remotely in real-time before using the PushingBox cloud service to sync up with Google Sheets as well.
